<p>A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. The best-known 
type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident 
victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care 
and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, 
seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain
disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.A teaching hospital combines assistance to 
people with teaching to medical students and nurses. The medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a 
range of departments (e.g.: surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and 
some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.<br>

 Hospitals are usually funded by the public sector, by health organisations (for profit or nonprofit), by health insurance companies, or by charities, 
including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.
In the 2010s, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, and nurses, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the 
founding religious orders and members of their order or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the 
Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and
Lutherans, which run hospitals.[4] In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally "places of hospitality", and this meaning
is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.

<h3 style="text-align:left;font-size:30px;">Funding</h3>
<p>
In the modern era, hospitals are, broadly, either funded by the government of the country in which they are situated, or survive financially by competing in the 
private sector (a number of hospitals also are still supported by the historical type of charitable or religious associations).
In the United Kingdom for example, a relatively comprehensive, "free at the point of delivery" health care system exists, funded by the state. Hospital care is thus
relatively easily available to all legal residents, although free emergency care is available to anyone, regardless of nationality or status. As hospitals prioritise
their limited resources, there is a tendency for 'waiting lists' for non-crucial treatment in countries with such systems, as opposed to letting higher-payers get 
treated first, so sometimes those who can afford it take out private health care to get treatment more quickly.On the other hand, some countries, including the 
USA, have in the twentieth century introduced a private-based, for-profit-approach to providing hospital care, with few state-money supported 'charity' hospitals 
remaining today.Where for-profit hospitals in such countries admit uninsured patients in emergency situations (such as during and after Hurricane Katrina in the
USA), they incur direct financial losses,ensuring that there is a clear disincentive to admit such patients. In the United States, laws exist to ensure patients
receive care in life-threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay.As the quality of health care has increasingly become an issue 
around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful 
ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is so
urced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission
from the USA, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and Haute Authorit� de sant� (HAS) from France.
